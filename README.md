# Mark Read's Academic CV

An acadmic CV differs from a resum√© in that it much more fully documents one's academic activities and achievements. 
I left academia in 2021, so am no longer active in this space. 
But for those wanting to see what I got up to, here it is. 

This was also a little project for me to explore continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) in GitHub. 
The PDF is built using GitHub Actions.
